5.	Write a SELECT statement that returns the product_name and list_price columns from the Products table.
Return one row for each product that has the same list price as another product. 
Hint: Use a self-join to check that the product_id columns arenâ€™t equal but the list_price columns are equal.
Sort the result set by product_name.


SELECT DISTINCT p1.product_name, p1.list_price
FROM Products p1
	JOIN Products p2 ON p1.product_id <> p2.product_id
	AND p1.list_price = p2.list_price
ORDER BY product_name

6.	Write a SELECT statement that returns these two columns: 
category_name	The category_name column from the Categories table
product_id	The product_id column from the Products table
Return one row for each category that has never been used. Hint: Use an outer join and only return rows where the product_id column contains a null value.
 
CATEGORY_NAME   PRODUCT_ID
NULL            NULL




7.	Use the UNION operator to generate a result set consisting of three columns from the Orders table: 
ship_status	A calculated column that contains a value of SHIPPED or NOT SHIPPED
order_id	The order_id column
order_date	The order_date column
If the order has a value in the ship_date column, the ship_status column should contain a value of SHIPPED. Otherwise, it should contain a value of NOT SHIPPED.
Sort the final result set by order_date.

SELECT 'Shipped' AS Status
		, Order_ID AS OrderID
		, Order_Date AS OrderDate
FROM Orders
	WHERE Ship_Date IS NOT NULL
UNION
	SELECT 'Not Shipped' AS Status
		, Order_ID AS OrderID
		, Order_Date AS OrderDate
FROM Orders
	WHERE Ship_Date IS NULL
ORDER BY OrderDate



STATUS      ORDERID       ORDERDATE
Shipped	        1	      28-MAR-12
Shipped	        2	      28-MAR-12
